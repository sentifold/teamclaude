// work, and creates and drives the sessions it serves. None of it is inference,
// and all of it is bound to the client's own login. Under a rotated fleet token
// the environment landed in a different account's org on each restart, creating
// its session answered 404, and the work poll, whose bearer is the environment
// secret rather than an OAuth token, drew a 401 from every account in turn.
//
// The account manager here throws from getActiveAccount, so any test that passes
// proves the relay never even consulted the fleet for that path.
