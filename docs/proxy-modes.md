# Proxy modes

Two independent things, both about how the traffic physically travels: how `claude` reaches TeamClaude, and how TeamClaude reaches Anthropic.

## MITM proxy mode (default)

The plain reverse-proxy only intercepts what `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` covers. Some Claude Code features (e.g. the **Claude Design MCP**) use a **hardcoded** `https://api.anthropic.com` URL that ignores that variable, so they bypass the proxy. MITM proxy mode captures those too, which is why it's the default for `teamclaude run` (and the shell alias):

```bash
teamclaude run -- <claude args...>
```

To opt out and route via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` only, pass `--no-mitm`:

```bash
teamclaude run --no-mitm -- <claude args...>
```

MITM mode launches claude pointed at TeamClaude as an **HTTPS forward proxy** (`HTTPS_PROXY`) and trusts a locally-generated CA (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`). For an intercepted host, TeamClaude **terminates** the tunnel with a real HTTP/2 server (HTTP/1.1 clients are handled too) presenting its local leaf, then **forwards each request with a buffering, retrying client** — the same path the base URL mode uses. On each request it:

- injects the active account's real credential, dropping any client `x-api-key`: OAuth accounts get `authorization: Bearer …`, API-key accounts get `x-api-key`;
- rewrites the **`account_uuid`** inside `metadata.user_id` to the active account's UUID (so the body agrees with the injected token);
- routes by the request's **`model`** (a Fable-exhausted account is skipped for Fable but still serves other models);
- reads `anthropic-ratelimit-*` from responses for quota; and
- **resends the request on a different account** if one returns a quota `429`, so a "you've reached your limit" is never surfaced while another account has headroom.

Because the request is buffered, the retry is transparent to claude. Client token refreshes (`/v1/oauth/token`), Remote Control (`/v1/code/*`, and the bridge's `/v1/environments/*`, `/v1/sessions/*`, `/v2/session_ingress/*` and `/v2/ccr-sessions/*`, which `claude remote-control` sends through `HTTPS_PROXY` since Claude Code 2.1.287) and claude.ai attachment transfers (`/api/oauth/files/*`, `/api/oauth/file_upload`) are passed through with the client's own credential, since they are bound to the paired identity and fail under a rotated token. Any host other than the upstream is blind-tunnelled. The server accepts *both* base-URL and proxy clients at once, so instances launched with and without `--no-mitm` can share one server.

A pool with Codex accounts also intercepts `chatgpt.com`. Inside that tunnel only `/backend-api/codex/*` is pooled; every other request (workspace discovery, plugins, settings) is passed through to `chatgpt.com` with the client's own login, and the Codex Responses WebSocket is refused so the CLI falls back to pooled HTTPS — see [Codex accounts](accounts.md#through-the-mitm-proxy-no-codex-config-needed). `chatgpt.com` is where ChatGPT Desktop talks to as well. On a machine running that app, set `proxy.terminalOnly` to `true` to tunnel that host untouched: the terminal Codex CLI keeps reaching the pool through its explicit `/backend-api/codex` base URL, and the desktop app keeps its own login.

### Trust model

- The CA is generated locally, stored in the config dir, and trusted **only** by the claude process you launch via `teamclaude run` (through `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`) — it is **never** added to your system trust store. The leaf private key is `0600`; the CA private key is never written to disk.
- TeamClaude still verifies the **real** Anthropic certificate on the upstream leg.

Verify the proxy and CA without any credentials — the proxy always answers a built-in test host:

```bash
# (with the server running and certs generated, e.g. after one `teamclaude run`)
curl --proxy http://localhost:3456 --cacert ~/.config/teamclaude-ca.pem https://www.example.org/
# → {"teamclaude":"mitm-proxy-ok","host":"www.example.org",...}
```

## Upstream proxy

For a host that has **no direct route to the internet** — the corporate case, where
every outbound connection must go through an HTTP proxy. Without it TeamClaude
fails with `connect ETIMEDOUT` on the first upstream request, even though Claude
Code itself works ([#155](https://github.com/KarpelesLab/teamclaude/issues/155)).

```json
{ "upstreamProxy": "http://user:pass@proxy.corp.example:3128" }
```

A bare `"proxy.corp.example:3128"` works too. Set it live from the TUI settings
screen (**Network → Upstream proxy**) — it applies to the next request, without a
restart.

- Covers **all** Anthropic-bound traffic: request forwarding, OAuth login, token
  refresh, profile and usage lookups, and (since per-account routing landed)
  `teamclaude api`, which used to go direct. The requests relayed with the
  client's own credential go through it too (Remote Control and its WebSocket,
  attachment transfers, and a Codex client's own `chatgpt.com` calls); they
  also used to go direct. A proxy that covered only some of them would leave
  you able to refresh an account but not add one, or the reverse.
- `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` are picked up automatically when the config sets
  nothing, so a machine already configured for other tools needs no extra setup.
  When that happens the server says so on startup, and the TUI marks the row with
  where the value came from — a proxy nobody typed into the config should never be
  silently in force.
- `NO_PROXY` (or `noProxy`) exempts hosts by suffix; `"upstreamProxy": false`
  ignores the environment entirely.
- **A proxy that is this server is refused.** `teamclaude env` exports
  `HTTPS_PROXY` pointing at TeamClaude, so a server or CLI started from that
  shell would inherit itself as its egress proxy — every upstream call would
  re-enter the proxy and be answered for whichever account it selected, silently
  (a usage probe would then store that one account's quota under all of them).
  A value whose address is our own listener is dropped, whether it came from the
  environment or the config, and the startup line and the TUI row say so.
- **TLS stays end-to-end.** The tunnel is a plain `CONNECT`; the proxy sees
  ciphertext only, and certificate verification is unchanged. A proxy that
  intercepts TLS needs its CA in `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`.
- SOCKS URLs are refused here (`http` `CONNECT` only), as is `https://` to the
  proxy itself: TeamClaude does not speak TLS *to* the proxy, and accepting the
  scheme would send the `CONNECT` (credentials included) in plaintext to port
  443. Write `http://host:port` — the tunnel through it is end-to-end TLS
  regardless. (SOCKS **is** supported one level down, per account: see
  [per-account routing](#per-account-routing) below.)

This is a property of the **network**, not a routing policy: when set, it is
simply how this machine reaches Anthropic. That is what separates it from sx.org
below, which is a specific egress *provider* chosen per request. If both are
configured, a request routed via sx.org uses sx.org; everything else uses the
upstream proxy. Neither is related to `proxy.port`, which is the local port
Claude Code connects **to**.

## Per-account routing

The fleet settings above move *every* account together. `accounts[].routing`
does the opposite: it pins **one** account to its own proxy and leaves the rest
untouched.

```bash
teamclaude login --name "waffles@waffle.com" --routing "socks5h://alice:s3cret@proxy.example.com:1080"
teamclaude routing waffles@waffle.com socks5h://alice:s3cret@proxy.example.com:1080
teamclaude routing waffles@waffle.com none   # back to the fleet path
```

```json
{ "name": "waffles@waffle.com", "type": "oauth", "routing": "socks5h://alice:s3cret@proxy.example.com:1080" }
```

- **All of that account's traffic** tunnels through it: request forwarding,
  OAuth login and token refresh, profile, usage and quota probes. A proxy that
  covered only some of those would strand the account mid-rotation.
- **Only that account.** Every other account keeps the fleet path, and the
  routed account ignores both the fleet upstream proxy and sx.org (chaining
  would be two hops for one problem).
- Schemes: `http` (CONNECT), `socks5`, `socks5h`, `socks4`, `socks4a`, with
  optional `user:pass@` auth (SOCKS4 takes a username only). The `h`/`a`
  suffixes follow curl's convention and resolve hostnames at the proxy; the
  bare forms resolve locally. A bare `host:port` is `http`.
- **TLS stays end-to-end** exactly as through the fleet proxy: the account's
  proxy relays ciphertext only, and certificate verification is unchanged.
- Changes apply live: the CLI command and disk edits both flow through the same
  reload as every other per-account field. The URL shows password-masked in
  `accounts`, `status`, the TUI and the dashboard.
- A new URL is tested first: a tunnel to the account's upstream and a TLS
  handshake, with no request sent. A proxy that does not answer is refused and
  nothing is saved (`--no-check` skips the test).
- A proxy that goes down later takes only its own account out. The request
  fails over to the next account and the routed one sits out for 30 seconds
  before its proxy is tried again. See
  [When the proxy is down](accounts.md#when-the-proxy-is-down).

Typical uses: one account that only answers from a specific region, an account
served through a jump host the others cannot use, or one seat whose traffic
must exit a particular network. See [accounts.md](accounts.md#per-account-routing-routing)
for the CLI reference.

## sx.org proxy mode

Off by default. Some transient `429`s key on the proxy's **outbound IP**, not the account, so rotating accounts doesn't help. To work around them, TeamClaude can route upstream requests through a residential proxy from [sx.org](https://sx.org), giving a different egress IP.

No sx.org account yet? Sign up through TeamClaude's referral link, **<https://sx.org/c/ufVrLW>** — it costs you nothing extra, and the referral supports TeamClaude development.

Open the TUI, press **`g`** for the settings screen, and put your sx.org API key in the **sx.org API key** row (stored in `config.sx.apiKey`). TeamClaude reuses an existing active proxy port on your sx.org account, or auto-creates a residential US one, and dials the upstream through it via HTTP `CONNECT` on **both** the reverse-proxy and MITM paths.

The **sx.org mode** row cycles with `←`/`→`:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| always | Tunnel **every** upstream request through sx.org. |
| on 429 only | Connect directly; on a `429` (which is IP-based), immediately retry that request through sx.org's fresh egress IP, no wait. On the MITM path, a recent `429` routes new tunnels through sx.org for a short window. |
| off | Never use sx.org, but **keep the API key** so you can re-enable it instantly. |

TLS is established **end-to-end with `api.anthropic.com` over the tunnel**, so the sx.org proxy only ever relays ciphertext and the real Anthropic certificate is still verified. Mode and key changes apply live (no restart). A **Clear sx.org key** row appears once a key is set, to forget it entirely.

> **Cost:** in **always** mode *all* Claude traffic flows through the residential proxy, which sx.org meters by bandwidth — expect real per-GB cost. **on 429 only** uses the proxy just when you're actually being throttled, so it's the cheaper way to ride out rate limits.
