// the machine was registered under whichever account rotation picked, a
// different org on each restart, and creating the session then answered 404.
// The work poll drew a 401 from every account in turn: its bearer is the

 * The message behind the synthetic 429, when no account can serve the request.
 *
 * The old wording — `All N accounts exhausted. Retry in 60s.` — was wrong in
 * three ways at once, and each one pushed the operator somewhere unhelpful
 * (#168):
 *
 *   - N counted every configured account, including ones the operator had
 *     disabled. An account deliberately out of rotation is not capacity that
 *     ran out.
 *   - it never named the model, so a family-specific refusal (Fable spent,
 *     Opus fine) read as the whole proxy being out of capacity.
 *   - "exhausted" reads terminal while "retry in 60s" reads transient, so the
 *     operator retried by hand instead of looking at what was actually blocked.
 *
 * Counts only the accounts that were candidates, names the model when the
 * request carried one, and says plainly that the wait is until a window resets.
 *
 * "Candidates" was the word but not the behaviour: the count went on filtering
 * the whole fleet by `disabled` alone, so a Codex request with three accounts to
 * its name reported all twelve as being at their quota — nine of them Anthropic
 * accounts it could never have used, and an operator reading that goes looking
 * for a fleet-wide outage. The set now arrives from the caller, already narrowed
 * (`candidateAccounts`), and is the same set the retry-after beside it was
 * measured from, so the number and the wait cannot disagree about who was even
 * asked.
 *
 * That wording was then wrong a different way (#407). One account at a real
 * family quota, another with headroom but in `error` — typically
 * `invalid_grant`, after a Claude Code `/login` elsewhere rotated the refresh
 * token — and the proxy rightly skips both, yet the client read "all 2 accounts
 * are at their quota or rate limit". The TUI went on showing the errored
 * account's quota bars with room in them, so the operator waited out a reset
 * that was never going to help, when the fix was `teamclaude login`.
 *
 * Blockers are told apart by the next step they call for, and there are three:
 * log in again, fix the account's routing proxy, or wait. A dead credential is read off `status === 'error'`
 * directly rather than through `unavailableReason`, for two reasons. It is
 * exactly the test `computeRetryAfter` uses to leave an account's clocks out of
 * the wait, so the accounts named here and the accounts the wait ignores are
 * one set by construction. And `unavailableReason` reports a budget cap or an
 * entitlement cooldown ahead of `error`, which would file a dead token under
 * "wait for the reset" whenever the two coincide. Everything that is not a dead
 * credential — quota, throttle, upstream rejection, a cap, and an OAuth
 * entitlement denial, which is an org-policy 403 on a timed cooldown and not
 * something a new login repairs — stays in the quota/rate-limit group.
 *
 * An account inside its routing cooldown (its own proxy could not be reached)
 * is the third: no quota is resetting, so "Quota resets in 28s" over a proxy
 * that is down would send the operator to the wrong screen.

// a placeholder. `message_delta` then reports figures that are cumulative for
// the whole message, so every field it carries supersedes the earlier one rather
// than adding to it.
//
// The two counters therefore consume the stream differently. `updateUsage` is
// incremental, so it takes each side at the event that settles it: input at
// `message_start`, output at `message_delta`. `merged` instead accumulates the
// message's final figures for a single `recordTokenUsage` once the stream is
// over. One record per message is what makes double counting unrepresentable
// rather than merely avoided.
//
// A Responses stream (the Codex path) instead reports once, at the end, and in
// OpenAI's own vocabulary — so it is rewritten into Anthropic's disjoint shape
// before it reaches either counter (src/responses-usage.js explains why the two
// disagree). It rides this function rather than a parser of its own because the
// line is ALREADY parsed here: the branch costs a Set lookup on a string, not a
// second pass over the stream. Nothing else would be cheap — a Responses stream
// is mostly text deltas, and the settled figures arrive on one event near the end
// with no header or marker to find it by.
//
// Reads one `data:` line. Both dialects carry exactly one per event, so a line
// is an event for this purpose, and the scanner above never has to hold more.

 * How long before this request is worth sending again: the seconds that become

 * It used to read three fields per account, and on a fleet of subscriptions all
 * three are routinely null — `quota.resetsAt` is set from the tokens/requests
 * headers an API key returns, and a subscription is metered by the unified
 * windows instead. So an account sitting at `unified7d` 1.00 with three days to
 * go looked like an account that knew nothing, every account did, and the
 * function fell through to its 60s default. The client honoured that default
 * forever: one silent retry a minute, a spinner, and no error ever reaching the
 * operator.
 *
 * Two rules keep the number honest.
 *
 * A window may only speak for a block it is imposing (`blockingResets`). A
 * 5-hour bucket at 12% that happens to refresh in four minutes is not why the
 * request was refused, and letting it answer would put the client back in the
 * one-minute loop wearing a different number.
 *
 * An account is blocked until the LAST of its blocks clears, so its own clocks
 * are taken at their maximum, while the fleet recovers when the FIRST account
 * does, so accounts are taken at their minimum. Mixing those up is how this
 * failure survives a half-fix: a spent subscription is usually throttled as
 * well, for the hour the 429 path clamps a relayed `retry-after` to, and reading
 * the sooner of the two would advertise an hour on a window with three days left
 * on it.
 *
 * A candidate that is out of this request with NO clock still bounds the wait,
 * at the old 60s default. Plenty of refusals carry no timestamp: an account this
 * very request already tried and lost to a socket error, an upstream `rejected`
 * verdict, an `exhausted` status, an operator cap, an advisor's spent bucket.
 * Such an account may well serve the next attempt, so letting it contribute
 * nothing hands the answer to whichever neighbour does have a clock — one
 * account spent for three days beside a healthy one that just dropped a
 * connection told the client to come back in three days, where it used to say a
 * minute. Only accounts that will not come back on their own are left out: the
 * disabled, and those in an error state waiting on a re-login. (An entitlement
 * quarantine always has a clock, so it answers with that.) With nobody left to
 * ask, the answer is still 60s.
 *
 * Deliberately uncapped: the truthful value is the whole point, and a ceiling
 * would rebuild the silent loop at whatever interval the ceiling was. Nothing
 * downstream sleeps on it unbounded — the hold path clamps its own poll to 60s
 * and the inline retry only fires under INLINE_RETRY_AFTER_MAX_SECONDS, both of
 * which a multi-day value simply steps past. Exported for tests.
